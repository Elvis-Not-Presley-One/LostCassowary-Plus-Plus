**More Info**

The program in its current state does not handle any nbt "decoding". All the program does in its current state is read one region file and outputs all of its info into a .dat file. 

I have added a copy of both zlib and a json lib in this repository so if anyone wanted to add any type of support they can. I also include some of the rewrites of the main.cpp that I have had to rewrite multiple times when trying to find out how to make my own nbt parser. so that might be a help to anyone trying to use this code. 

I am currently working on a java version of this program that will handle all of the nbt data and more in a more graceful manner. the java version will also include grapghs and hopefuly a 3d render of the region(s). 

The whole point of me workign on this in c/c++ was to try and mess around with the language. So if anyone wants to use the shity code for their projects they can. Yes I know the code is very bad and also slow and very disorginazed but it was a mini progect to learn more c/c++; Im also going to use the knowledge from this project for the java project since java is my main language. 

**How To Run The Program**


If for some reason you want to run this program you would need to have C++ downloaded with a Terminal of your choice with the text editor of your choice also. Since its c++ the progam should only be compatible for Windows since I did not add any support to any other OS since im lazy and dont feel like doing it. Thats another reason why I want to make an java version.
